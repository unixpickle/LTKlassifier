# LTKlassifier

This is a model that I will train on millions of retail images and social media posts [scraped from shopltk.com](https://github.com/unixpickle/ltk-scrape).

The goal of this project is to have a single model that can look at a photo (either from a retail website or a social media post) and predict price(s), retailer(s), and product categories.

A fun direction to go from here would be a social media app (e.g. a TikTok filter or Snapchat Lens) that tells you "how rich you look" by estimating the total price of the items you are showing in front of the camera.
